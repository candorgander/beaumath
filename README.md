# Beaumath -  A Beautiful Terminal-based Math processor

## What is beaumath?
Beaumath is a math processing software designed to run specifically in a Terminal-like environment. 

In it's current state, beaumath currently supports creating spreadsheet style tables that can dynamically perform calculations based on user commands. The table generated can be exported by the user into HTML, LaTeX and other formats to be used in websites or academic papers. 

## Why Beaumath?

Why not!? Beaumath was not designed for a specific use-case or for a niche user-base. It was made because it could be. 

## Underneath the Hood

Currently beaumath is heavily dependent on the the tabulate and python-prompt-toolkit.  The goal is the allow beaumath to be used as a module that can be imported, but is still a work in progress. 

## Documentation

The documentation of beaumath is currently under progress. An alpha version of the documentation will be available once the project has implemented basic features.

## Contributing

I believe that anyone can contribute to a project, whether they are a programmer or not.
